This mod adds pups to all campaigns and expeditions with some nice configurable features.\n\nUse it as you please, you can have a more Rain World like experience by leaving it with default options, or you can [b]customize it to make spawns lots of pups[/b] in the region xD. \n\nCheckout the [b]collection[/b] i've created it can make even funnier to play with.\n\n[i]Pinterest artist: Karma_De45.[/i]",
